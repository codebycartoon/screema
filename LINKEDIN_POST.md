🚀 Excited to share my latest project: SCREEMA - A Production-Ready Cinema Ticket Booking Platform!

After weeks of development, I'm proud to present a modern web application that demonstrates professional-level software engineering practices.

## 🎯 What I Built:

✅ Real-time interactive seat selection system
✅ User authentication & session management
✅ Complete payment flow integration
✅ Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
✅ Modern UI with shadcn/ui components
✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## 💻 Tech Stack:

• React 18 & TypeScript for type-safe development
• Vite for lightning-fast builds
• Tailwind CSS for modern styling
• TanStack Query for state management
• Supabase for backend services

## 📚 What Makes This Professional:

Beyond just working code, I focused on production-ready practices:
• Comprehensive documentation (10+ docs including architecture & API)
• Security best practices & vulnerability reporting
• Automated testing & deployment pipeline
• Clean code architecture with proper separation of concerns
• Complete developer setup guides

## 🎓 Key Learnings:

This project taught me that being a senior developer isn't just about writing code—it's about:
• System design & architecture thinking
• Professional documentation
• Security consciousness
• Maintainable, scalable code
• DevOps & CI/CD practices
